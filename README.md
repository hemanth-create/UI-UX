> **Attribution:** this repository is a fork of [VoltAgent/awesome-design-md](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-design-md). All the original DESIGN.md analysis is their work, used here under the MIT license. I maintain this copy for my own projects — see [Attribution & upstream](#attribution--upstream).

Copy a DESIGN.md into your project, tell your AI agent "build me a page that looks like this," and get UI that stays visually consistent with that design language.

These aren't surface-level style notes — each file carries analyzed patterns, color tokens, type scales, and component rules.


## What is DESIGN.md?

[DESIGN.md](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/docs/design-md/overview/) is a new concept introduced by Google Stitch. A plain-text design system document that AI agents read to generate consistent UI.

It's just a markdown file. No Figma exports, no JSON schemas, no special tooling. Drop it into your project root and any AI coding agent or Google Stitch instantly understands how your UI should look. Markdown is the format LLMs read best, so there's nothing to parse or configure.

| File | Who reads it | What it defines |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Coding agents | How to build the project |
| `DESIGN.md` | Design agents | How the project should look and feel |

**This repo holds ready-to-use DESIGN.md files** extracted from real websites — 74 of them, one directory per site under [`design-md/`](design-md).



## Collection

Every entry links to the rendered version on getdesign.md. The raw file also lives in this repo at `design-md/<name>/DESIGN.md` if you'd rather copy it straight from here.

### Retro Web · DESIGN.md Nostalgia

A Saturday series — DESIGN.md files extracted from the web of the 1990s. Drop one in and tell your AI agent to build a period-accurate vintage UI.

- [**Dell (1996)**](https://getdesign.md/dell-1996/design-md) - Catalog-era enterprise web. Literal black page frame, flat color-block "ribbon cards", chunky Helvetica-Black titles over Times Roman body, and hand-cut GIF stickers (NEW! bursts, award seals, beveled product photos).
- [**Nintendo.com (2001)**](https://getdesign.md/nintendo-2001/design-md) - Y2K "console chrome" web. Brushed-periwinkle beveled metal panels, a halftone-dotted carbon nav glowing amber, outlined Arial-Black box-art wordmarks over circuit-board hero fields, and a pixel Mario welcome bubble.


## What's Inside Each DESIGN.md

Every file follows the [Stitch DESIGN.md format](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/docs/design-md/specification/) with extended sections:

| # | Section | What it captures |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | Visual Theme & Atmosphere | Mood, density, design philosophy |
| 2 | Color Palette & Roles | Semantic name + hex + functional role |
| 3 | Typography Rules | Font families, full hierarchy table |
| 4 | Component Stylings | Buttons, cards, inputs, navigation with states |
| 5 | Layout Principles | Spacing scale, grid, whitespace philosophy |
| 6 | Depth & Elevation | Shadow system, surface hierarchy |
| 7 | Do's and Don'ts | Design guardrails and anti-patterns |
| 8 | Responsive Behavior | Breakpoints, touch targets, collapsing strategy |
| 9 | Agent Prompt Guide | Quick color reference, ready-to-use prompts |

Each site directory here contains:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `DESIGN.md` | The design system — this is what agents read |
| `README.md` | A short human-readable summary of the site's design language |

Rendered previews (color swatches, type scale, component catalogs in light and dark) live on [getdesign.md](https://getdesign.md) rather than in this repo.

### How to Use

1. Copy a site's `DESIGN.md` into your project root
2. Tell your AI agent to use it — e.g. *"Follow DESIGN.md and build me a pricing page"*

It works with any agent that reads files from your project: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Google Stitch, and others.
